This C# applications calculates and then displays the factorial of a given integer (in this example, 6). Here's a detailed breakdown of what happens in the program:
1.	1. The program starts with conventional C# directives, including references to several namespaces for input and output operations.
2.	2. It establishes a "Factorial" namespace and a "Program" class within that namespace.
3.	3. Within the "Program" class, the "Main" method is specified as the program's entry point, and it takes an array of strings as an argument (string[] args).
4.	4. The application creates an integer variable called "startingNumber" and assigns the value 6 to it. This is the number that will be used to compute the factorial.
5.	5. The program then invokes the "factorial" function, supplying "startingNumber" as an input, and prints the result to the console with the "Console.Out.WriteLine" method.
6.	6. Within the "factorial" procedure, the software writes the value of "x" to the console, showing the variable being calculated's current value. This is useful in comprehending the recursive process.
7.	7. The "factorial" approach is a recursive function that computes a number's factorial. If "x" equals 1, the basic case is reached, and it returns 1. If "x" is not one, it calls itself recursively with the parameter "x - 1" and multiplies the result by "x."
8.	8. The recursion continues until "x" equals one, at which time the computed values are multiplied together to provide the final factorial.
9.	9. The factorial value is calculated and returned to the "Main" procedure, where it is reported to the console.
10.	The computer program then uses "Console.ReadLine()" to avoid the console window from shutting too quickly.
So, the computer program computes and outputs the factorial of 6, which is 720, and you can see the intermediate values of "x" as the recursive process continues.

The program begins with the standard C# library using directives:
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
2. Within that namespace, the program establishes a namespace called "Factorial" and a class called "Program":
namespace Factorial {
    class Program {
3. The "Main" method is the program's starting point within the "Program" class:
static void Main(string[] args) {
4. The application creates an integer variable called "startingNumber" and assigns the value 6 to it. The following is the number for which the factorial will be computed:
int startingNumber = 6;
5. The program invokes the "factorial" function, supplying "startingNumber" as an input, and prints the result to the console with the "Console.Out.WriteLine" method:
Console.Out.WriteLine(factorial(startingNumber));
6. Within the "factorial" procedure, the software writes the value of "x" to the console, showing the variable being calculated's current value:
Console.Out.WriteLine("x is {0}", x);
7. The "factorial" approach is a recursive function that computes a number's factorial. If "x" equals 1, the basic case is reached, and it yields 1:
if (x == 1) {
    return 1;
}
8. If "x" is not one, it calls itself recursively with the parameter "x - 1" and multiplies the result by "x":
return x * factorial(x - 1);
9. The recursion continues until "x" equals 1, at which time the computed values are multiplied to obtain the final factorial.

10. The factorial value is calculated and returned to the "Main" method, where it is reported to the console:
Console.Out.WriteLine(factorial(startingNumber));
11. To avoid the console window from shutting prematurely, the application uses "Console.ReadLine()" to wait for user input:
Console.ReadLine();
In summary, the code computes and prints the factorial of 6 and displays the intermediate values of "x" as it traverses the recursive process.
The explanation concludes that the C# software uses a recursive function to determine the factorial of the number 6, which is 720. It also walks you through the program's essential components and operations, such as the recursive "factorial" function, the intermediate value of "x" displayed in the console, and the outcome reported to the console. Before it exists, the software waits for user input.
